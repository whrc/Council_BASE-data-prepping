title: "Council BASE gapfilling with ERA5 with Kyle" #Here we are prepping the ERA5 model to use for gapfilling in the Ameriflux BASE dataset. EAR5 is hourly, so we break it into half-hourly increments to match that of Ameriflux, and we gapfill those half-hours so we have a continuous dataset to be able to fill in the gaps within the BASE Ameriflux dataset. (Might be slightly different it you're using the Ameriflux Fullset dataset*)

#Notes: ERA5 is a climate model we use to gap-fill -- we use GoogleEarth Engine to download the maps for our specific location (see Kyle about this / Kyle will teach us and share the code for that later). We need to reformat the ERA5 model data so it matches well with the Ameriflux datafile so we can use it to gapfill in later steps.
